ROCK (Reinforcement Open Construction Kit) is a easy-to-use, and scalable sandbox environment management framework, primarily for agentic reinforcement learning environments. It provides tools for building, managing, and scheduling reinforcement learning environments, suitable for development, testing, and research scenarios.

ROCK adopts a client-server architecture, supports different levels of isolation mechanisms to ensure stable environment operation, and supports integration with various reinforcement learning training frameworks through SDK. ROCK not only supports traditional sandbox management functions but also is compatible with GEM-like protocols, providing standardized interfaces for reinforcement learning environments.

## 🚀 Get Started
[Documents](https://alibaba.github.io/ROCK/)

### Quick Start

[Installation](https://alibaba.github.io/ROCK/docs/installation)  
[Quick Start](https://alibaba.github.io/ROCK/docs/quickstart)  
[Configuration](https://alibaba.github.io/ROCK/docs/configuration)  
[API References](https://alibaba.github.io/ROCK/docs/api)

---
Intall ROCK with `pip` or source, and start the local admin server:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/alibaba/ROCK.git
cd ROCK

# Create virtual environment (using uv-managed Python)
uv venv --python 3.11 --python-preference only-managed

# Install dependencies using uv
uv sync --all-extras

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Start admin server
uv run admin --env local
```

**Notes**: ROCK depends on Docker and uv tools for environment management.

1. **Python Environment Configuration**: To ensure ROCK can correctly mount the project and virtual environment along with its base Python interpreter, it is strongly recommended to use uv-managed Python environments to create virtual environments rather than system Python. This can be achieved through the `--python-preference only-managed` parameter.

2. **Distributed Environment Consistency**: In distributed multi-machine environments, please ensure that all machines use the same root Python interpreter for ROCK and uv Python configurations to avoid environment inconsistencies.

3. **Dependency Management**: Use the `uv` command to install all dependency groups, ensuring consistency between development, testing, and production environments.

4. **OS Support**: ROCK recommends managing environments on the same operating system, such as managing Linux image environments on a Linux system. However, it also supports cross-operating system level image management, for example, launching Ubuntu images on MacOS. 

### Using Env Protocol
ROCK is fully compatible with the GEM protocol, providing standardized environment interfaces:

```python
import rock
import random
# Create environment using GEM standard interface
env_id = "game:Sokoban-v0-easy"
env = rock.make(env_id)

# Reset environment
observation, info = env.reset(seed=42)

while True:
    # Interactive environment operations
    action = f"\\boxed{{{random.choice(['up', 'left', 'right', 'down'])}}}"
    observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)

    if terminated or truncated:
        break

# Close environment
env.close()
```

### Sandbox SDK Usage
```python
import asyncio

from rock.actions import CreateBashSessionRequest
from rock.sdk.sandbox.client import Sandbox
from rock.sdk.sandbox.config import SandboxConfig


async def run_sandbox():
    config = SandboxConfig(image="python:3.11", memory="8g", cpus=2.0)
    sandbox = Sandbox(config)

    await sandbox.start()
    await sandbox.create_session(CreateBashSessionRequest(session="bash-1"))
    result = await sandbox.arun(cmd="echo Hello Rock", session="bash-1")
    await sandbox.stop()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(run_sandbox())
```

## 🛠️ System Architecture

### ROCK Service Architecture
The service layer implements a distributed architecture with three core node roles:
- **ROCK SDK**: Environment development toolkit that provides development tools to assist developers in building, registering, deploying, and accessing Environments.
- **ROCK CLI**: Command-line interface tool that helps users manage and operate Environments and Services.
- **ROCK Admin**: The scheduling node responsible for deploying Environments as Sandboxes and managing Sandbox resource scheduling and allocation
- **ROCK Worker**: The working node that allocates machine physical resources to Sandboxes and executes the specific Sandbox runtime
- **ROCK Rocklet**: A lightweight proxy service component that handles SDK-to-Sandbox Action communication and supports external internet service access
- **ROCK Envhub**: Environment repository that provides registration and storage for Environment data.

### Core Technologies
- **Distributed Architecture**: Multi-node design with Admin, Worker, and Rocklet components for scalability
- **Runtime Isolation**: Stateful sandbox runtimes with multiple isolation mechanisms
- **Flexible Deployment**: Support for different deployment methods for diverse environment requirements and Operating System
- **Protocol Compatibility**: Support for multiple interaction protocols 
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker-based container management with resource allocation


#### GEM Protocol Support
ROCK maintains compatibility with GEM interfaces for reinforcement learning environments:
- `make(env_id)`: Create environment instance
- `reset(seed)`: Reset environment state
- `step(action)`: Execute action and return results

GEM environments follow standard return formats:
```python
# reset() returns
observation, info = env.reset()

# step() returns
observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
```

## 📄 Configuration

### Server Configuration
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Start Rock service, local startup
admin --env local
```

> **Service Information**: The ROCK Local Admin service runs by default on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. You can access this address through your browser to view the management interface.
For additional configuration information such as logs and Rocklet service startup methods, please refer to [Configuration](docs/rock/configuration.md)

### Development Environment Configuration
```bash
# Sync dependencies using uv
uv sync --all-extras --all-groups

# Run in virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run tests
uv run pytest tests
```
