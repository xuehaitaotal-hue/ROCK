- Renamed `write_file_directly` to `write_file_by_path` for clarity

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed PID extraction to use bash-compatible patterns
- Corrected PIPE redirect strategy
- Fixed status retrieval for write cluster operations
- Improved exception handling for service startup failures

## Admin

### New Features

#### Enhanced Observability
- Added OpenTelemetry metrics cleanup for expired timelines
- In-memory metric reader for test cases
- Enhanced logging for model service operations

#### System Improvements
- Read-only mount path support for enhanced security
- Enhanced status retrieval for write clusters
- Improved exception handling for service startup

### Enhancements

#### Actor System
- Reconstructed actor pip dependencies for better management

- Improved image building with experiment ID tracking
- Upgraded image tag management

#### Model Service (Admin)
- Enhanced ModelService start logic
- Added lock mechanism for thread-safe operations
- Parallel initialization with SWE Agent
- Proxy support for model requests
- Type-based model selection

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed status retrieval for write cluster operations
- Corrected PIPE redirect strategy
- Improved exception handling for service startup failures

## System-Wide Changes

### Refactoring
- Removed `InternalRequest` class for cleaner architecture
- Replaced `DockerEnvHub` with `DockerValidator` in docker deployment
- Moved `is_absolute_db_path` to database module
- Removed unused API keys and cleaned up tests
- Removed redundant `DockerDeploymentConfig` imports

### Logging Improvements
- Updated logger format for better readability
- Added `__str__` and `__repr__` methods to Sandbox class
- Prevented logger propagation in `init_logger` function
- Added logging for config loading in CLI

### CLI Enhancements
- Added system resource limits
- Enhanced EnvHub precheck functionality
- Improved CLI command structure and organization

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive release notes
- Created ROCK & ROLL quick start guides
- Enhanced GitHub Actions CI workflows
- Improved issue templates for better bug reporting
- Added statistics page for GitHub metrics

### Testing
- Optimized test cases with in-memory metric reader
- Enhanced test coverage for new features
- Improved test loader path resolution

## Migration Guide

### Breaking Changes
- `InternalRequest` class has been removed. Use standard request classes instead.
- `write_file_directly` method renamed to `write_file_by_path`
- `download_file` method has been removed

### Recommended Actions
1. Update any code using `InternalRequest` to use standard request classes
2. Replace `write_file_directly` calls with `write_file_by_path`
3. Review and update timeout configurations in EnvBuilder
4. Test remote user functionality if using sandbox isolation
5. Update model service integration to use new proxy and type selection features
